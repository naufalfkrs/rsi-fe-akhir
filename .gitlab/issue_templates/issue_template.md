| Test Objective | To validate a specific feature or functionality of the software, ensuring it behaves as expected.                                                                      |
| Pre-condition  | The setup or state that needs to be in place before the test can be executed. This might include hardware requirements, software configurations, or prior test results. |
| Steps          | A detailed list of the actions required to carry out the test. These should be clear and concise so anyone can follow them to reproduce the test scenario.              |
| Test Data      | The specific inputs, datasets, or other information needed for the test. Include any expected parameters or conditions.                                               |
| Expected Result | The anticipated outcome of the test if everything is functioning correctly. This might include specific outputs, system states, or error messages.                      |
| Post Condition | The state of the system after the test is completed. This can indicate whether further cleanup or resetting is needed.                                                  |
